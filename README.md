# Open Thumb

This is a placeholder repo for an intended fork of [thumb-key](https://github.com/dessalines/thumb-key), with the goal of better aligning with the usability of [MessagEase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MessagEase) after the [subscription debacle](https://twitter.com/_ragingdawn/status/1753840734602686825)

After forking the code I realized that I'm further from being capable of working with it than I imagined, and I still want a working fork to provide patches to thumb-key in the meantime (GH doesn't let me have two forks), so I deleted the old repo with this name.

I'm still getting a hold of Kotlin and Android app dev in general, once I'm confident enough I'll restart my work.

The short-term goals of the project will be:
- User-defined layouts instead of source code (see [discussion](https://github.com/asdkant/open-thumb/discussions/1) on layout definition format)
- Gestures in general, "swipe-and-back" being the most urgent one for me.

In the meantime my work related to this will live in https://github.com/asdkant/thumb-key
